I'm a PhD student at the Department of Computer, Control, and Management Engineering (DIAG) Antonio Ruberti (Sapienza University), advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=mHbdIAwAAAAJ">Prof Barbara Caputo</a>.
My research area includes computer vision and machine learning. I am now focusing on object categorization using multimodal information (specifically depth sensor data) and domain adaptation. </p>
