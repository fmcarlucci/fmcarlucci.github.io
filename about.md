title: About & Contacts
---

I'm a PhD student at the Department of Computer, Control, and Management Engineering (DIAG) Antonio Ruberti (Sapienza University), advised by [Prof Barbara Caputo](https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=mHbdIAwAAAAJ).
My research area includes computer vision and machine learning. I'm currently focussing on object categorization using multimodal information (specifically depth sensor data) and domain adaptation. 

## Contacts

I'm currently working at the **VANDAL** lab, room B004 of the DIAG, Sapienza University of Rome (Via Ariosto 25, 00185 Rome - ITALY).
