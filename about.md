I am currently a research scientist at Huawei, London. Previously I obtained a PhD from the Department of Computer, Control, and Management Engineering (DIAG) Antonio Ruberti (Sapienza University), advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=mHbdIAwAAAAJ">Prof Barbara Caputo</a>.
 
 
My research area includes computer vision and machine learning. Currently I am focusing on the topic of AutoML. Previously, I researched the topics of object categorization, using multimodal information (specifically depth sensor data), and domain adaptation. </p>
